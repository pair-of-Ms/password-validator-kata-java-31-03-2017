Password Validator Kata in Java

We want to ensure that our users' passwords have the following rules:

  - Have more than 8 characters
	- Contains a capital letter
	- Contains a lowercase
	- Contains a number
	- Contains an underscore

This kata shows the importance of:

  - having good examples (testing only one thing and being honest)
  - selecting examples to test in an adequate order
